## INTRODUCTION
### Python Language Introduction

  ☞ Python may be a wide used general, high level programing language. It absolutely was at first designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python computer code Foundation. It absolutely was chiefly developed for stress on code readability, and its syntax permits programmers to precise ideas in fewer lines of code.
  
  ☞ Python may be a programing language that allows you to work quickly and integrate systems a lot of expeditiously.
  
  ☞ Python may be a high-level, taken, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is meant to be extremely decipherable. It uses English keywords often wherever as different languages use punctuation, and its fewer grammar constructions than different languages.
  
  ☞ Python is taken Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You are doing not have to be compelled to compile your program before execution it. This can be like PERL and PHP.
  
  ☞ Python is Interactive − you'll really sit at a Python prompt and act with the interpreter on to write your programs.
  
  ☞ Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented vogue or technique of programming that encapsulates code inside objects.
  
  ☞ Python may be a Beginner's Language − Python may be a nice language for the beginnerlevel programmers and supports the event of a large vary of applications from easy text process to web browsers to games.
  
## PYTHON TKINTER GUI
### Tkinter Programming

Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-orientedinterface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Creating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to do is perform the following steps −

⭐️ Import the Tkinter module.

⭐️ Create the GUI application main window.

⭐️ Add one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.

⭐️ Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.




## Tkinter Widgets
Tkinter provides various controls, such as buttons, labels and text boxes used in a GUI application. These controls are commonly called widgets. There are currently 15 types of widgets in Tkinter. We present these widgets as well as a brief description in the following table −

🔘 Button: The Button widget is used to display buttons in your application.

🔘 Canvas: The Canvas widget is used to draw shapes, such as lines, ovals, polygons and rectangles, in your application.

🔘 Checkbutton: The Checkbutton widget is used to display a number of options as checkboxes. The user can select multiple options at a time.

🔘 Entry: The Entry widget is used to display a single-line text field for accepting values from a user.

🔘 Frame: The Frame widget is used as a container widget to organize other widgets.

🔘 Label: The Label widget is used to provide a single-line caption for other widgets. It can also contain images.

🔘 Listbox: The Listbox widget is used to provide a list of options to a user.

🔘 Menubutton: The Menubutton widget is used to display menus in your application.

🔘 Menu: The Menu widget is used to provide various commands to a user. These commands are contained inside Menubutton.

🔘 Message: The Message widget is used to display multiline text fields for accepting values from a user.

🔘 Radiobutton: The Radiobutton widget is used to display a number of options as radio buttons. The user can select only one option at a time.

🔘 Scale: The Scale widget is used to provide a slider widget.

🔘 Scrollbar: The Scrollbar widget is used to add scrolling capability to various widgets, such as list boxes.

🔘 Text: The Text widget is used to display text in multiple lines.

🔘 Toplevel: The Toplevel widget is used to provide a separate window container.

🔘 Spinbox: The Spinbox widget is a variant of the standard Tkinter Entry widget, which can be used to select from a fixed number of values.

🔘 PanedWindow: A PanedWindow is a container widget that may contain any number of panes, arranged horizontally or vertically.

🔘 LabelFrame: A labelframe is a simple container widget. Its primary purpose is to act as a spacer or container for complex window layouts.

🔘 tkMessageBox: This module is used to display message boxes in your applications.


## Geometry Management
All Tkinter widgets have access to specific geometry management methods, which have the purpose of organizing widgets throughout the parent widget area. Tkinter exposes the following geometry manager classes: pack, grid, and place.

◆ The pack() Method − This geometry manager organizes widgets in blocks before placing them in the parent widget.

◆ The grid() Method − This geometry manager organizes widgets in a table-like structure in the parent widget.

◆ The place() Method − This geometry manager organizes widgets by placing them in a specific position in the parent widget.


## BASIC FUNCTIONS

☆ Addition: The addition (sum function) is used by clicking on the "+" button or using the keyboard. The function results in (a+b).

☆ Subtraction: The subtraction (minus function) is used by clicking on the "-" button or using the keyboard. The function results in (a-b).

☆ Multiplication: The multiplication (times function) is used by clicking on the "x" button or using the keyboard"*" key. The function results in a*b.

☆ Division: The division (divide function) is used by clicking on the "/" button or using the keyboard "/" key. The function results in (a/b).

☆ Sign: The sign key (negative key) is used by clicking on the "(-)" button. The function results in -1*x.

☆ Square Root: The square root function is used by clicking "sqrt()". This function represents x^0.5 where the result squared is equal to x.

☆ Logarithm: The logarithm (LOG) is used by clicking on the "log" button or type "log(" .

☆ Exponent: Numbers with exponents of 10 are displayed with an "e", for example 4.5e+100 or 4.5e-100.This function represents 10^x. Numbers are automatically displayed in the format when the number is too large or too small for the display. To enter a number in this format use the exponent key "exp". To do this enter the mantissa (the non-exponent part) then press "exp" and then enter the exponent.

☆ Factorial: The Factorial function is used by clicking the "factorial" button or type "factorial".
